  <title>Document Conventions</title>
  <para>This manual uses several conventions to highlight certain words and phrases and draw attention to specific pieces of information.
 </para>
  <para>In PDF and paper editions, this manual uses typefaces drawn from the <ulink url="https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/">Liberation Fonts</ulink> set. The Liberation Fonts set is also used in HTML editions if the set is installed on your system. If not, alternative but equivalent typefaces are displayed. 
 </para>

    <title>Typographic Conventions</title>
    <para>The following <application>typographic</application> conventions are used to call attention to specific words and phrases. These conventions, and the circumstances they apply to, are as follows.
  </para>
    <para>System input, including shell commands, file names and paths, and  key caps and key-combinations are presented as follows.
  </para>
    <blockquote>
      <para>
    To see the contents of the file <filename>my_next_bestselling_novel</filename> in your current working directory, enter the <command>cat my_next_bestselling_novel</command> command at the shell prompt and press <keycap>Enter</keycap> to execute the command.
   </para>
    </blockquote>
    <para>The above includes a file name, a shell command and a key cap, all  distinguishable thanks to context.
  </para>
    <para>Key-combinations can be distinguished from key caps by the symbol connecting each part of a key-combination. For example:
  </para>
    <blockquote>
      <para>
    Press <keycap>Enter</keycap> to execute the command.
   </para>
      <para>
    Press  <keycombo>
          <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
          <keycap>Alt</keycap>
          <keycap>F1</keycap>
        </keycombo> to switch to the first virtual terminal. Press <keycombo>
          <keycap>Ctrl</keycap>
          <keycap>Alt</keycap>
          <keycap>F7</keycap>
        </keycombo> to return to your X-Windows session.
   </para>
    </blockquote>
    <para>The first sentence highlights the particular key cap to press. The second highlights two sets of three key caps, each set pressed simultaneously.
  </para>
    <para>If source code is discussed, class names, methods, functions, variable names and returned values mentioned within a paragraph are  presented as follows.
  </para>
    <blockquote>
      <para>
    File-related classes include <classname>filesystem</classname> for file systems, <classname>file</classname> for files, and <classname>dir</classname> for directories. Each class has its own associated set of permissions.
   </para>
    </blockquote>
    <para>Words or phrases encountered on a system, including application names; dialog box text; labeled buttons; check-box and radio button labels; menu titles and sub-menu titles are presented as follows.
  </para>
    <blockquote>
      <para>Choose <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>System</guimenu>
          <guimenuitem>Preferences</guimenuitem>
          <guisubmenu>Mouse</guisubmenu>
        </menuchoice>    from the main menu bar to launch <application>Mouse Preferences</application>. In the <guilabel>Buttons</guilabel> tab, click the <guilabel>Left-handed mouse</guilabel> check box and click <guibutton>Close</guibutton> to switch the primary mouse button from the left to the right (making the mouse suitable for use in the left hand).
   </para>
      <para>To insert a special character into a <application>gedit</application> file, choose <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>Applications</guimenu>
          <guimenuitem>Accessories</guimenuitem>
          <guisubmenu>Character Map</guisubmenu>
        </menuchoice>   from the main menu bar. Next, choose <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>Search</guimenu>
          <guimenuitem>Find</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>  from the <application>Character Map</application> menu bar, type the name of the character in the <guilabel>Search</guilabel> field and click <guibutton>Next</guibutton>. The character you sought will be highlighted in the <guilabel>Character Table</guilabel>. Double-click this highlighted character to place it in the <guilabel>Text to copy</guilabel> field and then click the <guibutton>Copy</guibutton> button. Now switch back to your document and choose <menuchoice>
          <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>
          <guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem>
        </menuchoice>  from the <application>gedit</application> menu bar.
   </para>
    </blockquote>
    <para>The above  text includes application names; system-wide menu names and items; application-specific menu names; and buttons and text found within a GUI interface, all  distinguishable by context.
  </para>
    <para>Note the  shorthand used to indicate traversal through a menu and its sub-menus. This is to avoid the difficult-to-follow &apos;Select <guimenuitem>Mouse</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>Preferences</guimenu> sub-menu in the <guimenu>System</guimenu> menu of the main menu bar&apos; approach.
  </para>
    <para>Italics denotes text you do not input literally or displayed text that changes depending on circumstance. Replaceable or variable text is presented as follows.
  </para>
    <blockquote>
      <para>To connect to a remote machine using ssh, type <command>ssh <replaceable>username</replaceable>@<replaceable>domain.name</replaceable></command> at a shell prompt. If the remote machine is <filename>example.com</filename> and your username on that machine is john, type <command>ssh john@example.com</command>.
   </para>
      <para>
    The <command>mount -o remount <replaceable>file-system</replaceable></command> command remounts the named file system. For example, to remount the <filename>home</filename> file system, the command is <command>mount -o remount /home</command>.
   </para>
      <para>
    To see the version of a currently installed package, use the <command>rpm -q <replaceable>package</replaceable></command> command. It will return a result as follows: <command>
          <replaceable>package-version-release</replaceable>
        </command>.
   </para>
    </blockquote>
    <para>Note the words in bold italics above &mdash; username, domain.name, file-system, package, version and release. Each word is a placeholder, either for text you enter when issuing a command or for text displayed by the system.
  </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Pull-quote Conventions</title>
    <para>
   Two, commonly multi-line, data types are set off visually from the surrounding text.
  </para>
    <para>
   Output sent to a terminal is presented as follows:
  </para>
    <screen>
books        Desktop   documentation  drafts  mss    photos   stuff  svn
books_tests  Desktop1  downloads      images  notes  scripts  svgs
</screen>
    <para>
   Source-code listings are presented and highlighted as follows:
  </para>
    <programlisting language="Java" role="JAVA">
package org.jboss.book.jca.ex1;

import javax.naming.InitialContext;

public class ExClient
{
   public static void main(String args[]) 
       throws Exception
   {
      InitialContext iniCtx = new InitialContext();
      Object         ref    = iniCtx.lookup(&quot;EchoBean&quot;);
      EchoHome       home   = (EchoHome) ref;
      Echo           echo   = home.create();

      System.out.println(&quot;Created Echo&quot;);

      System.out.println(&quot;Echo.echo(&apos;Hello&apos;) = &quot; + echo.echo(&quot;Hello&quot;));
   }
   
}
</programlisting>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>Notes and Warnings</title>
    <para>Finally, we use three visual styles to draw attention to information that might otherwise be overlooked.
  </para>
    <warning>
      <title>Warning</title>
      <para>A Warning should not be ignored. Ignoring warnings will most likely cause data loss.
   </para>
    </warning>
    <important>
      <title>Important</title>
      <para>Important boxes detail things that are easily missed: configuration changes that only apply to the current session, or services that need restarting before an update will apply. Ignoring Important boxes won&apos;t cause data loss but may cause irritation and frustration.
   </para>
    </important>
    <note>
      <title>Note</title>
      <para>A note is a tip or shortcut or alternative approach to the task at hand. Ignoring a note should have no negative consequences, but you might miss out on a trick that makes your life easier.
   </para>
    </note>
